A simple SPA (single page application).  

Use **Jade** to write HTML, **Less** to write CSS , **RequireJs** to load JavaScript, and **Gulp** to build.  

### How to Build

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `gulp server` to generate the static site (place under `dist`).
3. Run `gulp server` and visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html` if you want to see it hosted locally(make sure the port 8000 is not taken).
4. Run `gulp deploy` to deploy to github pages.
